        <p class="miaoshu">In 1626, Manhattan Island was purchased（购买）from the Indians by Peter Minuit. It cost about $ 2,400. At first, it was called New Amsterdam by the Dutch settlers. Later it was renamed New York by the English.
        The city grew rapidly. There were several reasons for this, but the most important one is its location. New York is situated on the best American harbor on the Atlantic Ocean. It also lies on the Hudson River, which allows water transportation into the middle of the United States.
        Today New York has a population of approximately eight million. The city has groups from many races. It is famous for its Chinatown. It also has the largest Jewish population of any city outside Israel. After the blacks were released from slavery, a large number of them moved into cities like New York, Philadelphia, and Washington. More recently, people from Puerto Rico have done the same thing.
        New York is made up of five boroughs（行政区）. The Bronx is the only one located on the mainland, with Brooklyn, Richmond, and Queens being on islands. It is a large manufacturing center because factories can be located near good water transportation. Two of the main businesses are the clothing industry and the printing industry. Most large publishing companies have their headquarters there.

        <p class="miaoshu">In the United States, it is not customary to telephone someone very early in the morning. If you telephone him early in the day, while he is shaving or having breakfast, the time of the call shows that the matter is very important and requires immediate attention. The same meaning is attached to telephone calls made after 11:00 pm. If someone receives a call during sleeping hours, he assumes it's a matter of life or death. The time chosen for the call communicates its importance.
        In social life, time plays a very important part. In the U.S.A. guests tend to feel they are not highly regarded if the invitation to a dinner party is extended only three or four days before the party date. But it is not true in all countries. In other areas of the world, it may be considered foolish to make an appointment too far in advance because plans which are made for a date more than a week away tend to be forgotten. The meaning of time differs in different parts of the world. Thus, misunderstandings arise between people from different cultures that treat time differently. Promptness is valued highly in American life, for example. If people are not prompt, they may be regarded as impolite or not fully responsible. In the U.S. no one would think of keeping a business associate waiting for an hour, it would be too impolite. A person, who is 5 minutes late, will say a few words of explanation, though perhaps he will not complete the sentence..</p>

        <p class="miaoshu">There was a woman in Detroit, who had two sons. She was worried about them, especially the younger one, Ben, because he was not doing well in school. Boys in his class made jokes about him because he seemed so <em class="col-red">___21___</em>.
        The mother decided that she would herself have to get her sons to do better in school. She told them to go to the Detroit Public Library to read a book a week and do a book report for her.
        One day, in Ben's <em class="col-red">___22___</em>, the teacher held up a rock and asked if anyone knew it. Ben put up his hand and the teacher let him <em class="col-red">___23___</em>. “Why did Ben put up his hand?” his classmates wondered. “He never said anything. What could he possibly want to say?”
        Well, Ben not only <em class="col-red">___24___</em> the rock, but also said a lot about it. He named other rocks in its group and even knew where the teacher had found it. The teacher and the students were surprised. Ben had learned all this from doing one of his book reports.
        Ben later went on to the <em class="col-red">___25___</em> of his class. When he finished high school, he went to Yale University and at last became one of the best doctors in the United States．.</p>

        <p class="miaoshu">There are different ways in which people try to deal with the problem of energy. One way is the greater production of common energy sources, such as coal, oil and gas. The trouble with these sources, however, is that they are not renewable（可再生的）.
Another way is energy conservation（节能）, which means using energy more efficiently. In some very cold countries, people build special houses to save energy. They place materials between the inside and outside of the walls of the house to keep the cold out and the warmth in.
Finally, renewable energy sources are used even though they are often expensive to develop. One form of these is geothermal energy（地热）. In certain parts of the world, the temperature of the earth increases thirty degrees centigrade（摄氏）with each kilometer down. At six kilometers, therefore, it rises to nearly two hundred degrees. Heat from the earth is already used in some countries..</p>

        <p class="miaoshu">One day a bookseller（书商）let a big box of books fall on his foot. "Go to see the doctor," said his wife. "No, "he said. "I'll wait until the doctor comes into the shop next time. Then I'll ask him about my foot. If I go to see him, I'll have to pay him."
On the next day the doctor came into the shop for some books. When the bookseller was getting them ready, he told the doctor about his bad foot. The doctor looked at it.
"You must put that foot in hot water every night. Then you must put something on it," said the doctor.
He took out a piece of paper and wrote on it. "Buy this and put it on the foot before you go to bed every night," he said.
"Thank you," said the bookseller. "And now, sir, here are your books."
"How much?" said the doctor.
"Two pounds."
"Good," said the doctor. "I shall not have to pay you anything."
"Why?" asked the bookseller.
"I told you about your foot. I want two pounds for that. If people come to my house, I ask them to pay one pound for a small thing like that. But when I go to their houses, I want two pounds. And I came here, didn't I?".</p>

        <p class="miaoshu">Since his retirement, one day was just like any other day for John Smith. He woke <em class="col-red">__21__</em> precisely at 5:35 a.m.. He went downstairs with his pajamas (睡衣裤)at six o'clock and <em class="col-red">__22__</em> himself a cup of hot coffee from the pot which his wife, Mary, had filled and plugged in (给......通上电源)some fifteen minutes ago.

        It was terrible! He dropped the newspaper and cup. With closed eyes, he swallowed and began to shout: "Mary!". Mrs. Smith was unaccustomed to hearing her husband say much of anything. In fact for the past few days, he had hardly paid any attention at all to many of her important questions. She rushed back to the kitchen.
        "John, what is the matter? Oh, you've spilled coffee all over yourself and the newspaper."
        She was shocked <em class="col-red">__24__</em> her husband's behavior. She wondered what he had read that may have upset him so much. He was not amused at her innocent expression.
